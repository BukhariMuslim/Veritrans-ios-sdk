### Overview
Midtarns iOS SDK makes it easy to build an excellent payment experience in your iOS app. It provides powerful, customizable to collect your users' payment details.

We also expose the low-level APIs that power those elements to make it easy to build fully custom forms. This guide will take you all the way from integrating our SDK to accepting payments from your users via our payment method that we provide

#### <a id="install-and-configure-sdk"></a> Install and configure the SDK
You can choose to install the Stripe iOS SDK via your favorite method. We support CocoaPods and manual installation with both static and dynamic frameworks.

1. If you haven't already, install the latest version of [Cococapods](https://cocoapods.org/).
2. Add this line to your Podfile:


	```
	platform :ios, '7.0'

	def shared_pods
	pod 'MidtransCoreKit'
	end

	target 'MyBeautifulApp' do
	shared_pods
	end
	```
3. Run the following command:

	```
	pod install

	```
4. Don't forget to use the .xcworkspace file to open your project in Xcode, instead of the .xcodeproj file, from here on out.
5. In the future, to update to the latest version of the SDK, just run:

	```
	pod update MidtransCoreKit
	```

#### <a id="sdk-integration"></a> Integration
After you're done installing the SDK, configure it with your Stripe API keys.



```
#import "AppDelegate"
#import <Midtrans/MidtransCoreKit.h>


@implementation AppDelegate
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

	[[MIDClient shared] configureClientKey:`client_key`
						 merchantServerURL:`merchant url`
						 environment:'environment'];
    	return YES;
	}
@end

```
#### <a id="sdk-checkout"></a> Checkout
**Checkout provides your customers with a streamlined, mobile-ready payment experience.**

Checkout securely accepts your customer's payment details and directly passes them to Midtrans servers. Midtrans returns a token representation of those payment details, which can then be submitted to your server for use.
	
###<a id="sdk-checkout-standard"></a> Standard

Our SDK provides a class called `MIDClient`, which is designed to make building your app's checkout flow as easy as possible. It handles payment options such as payment chanels, customer information and can also be used to collect shipping info.

**Setting checkout and host view controller**

To work with Midtrans Checkout, you'll need to write a class that conforms to STPPaymentContextDelegate. (Note, the code samples in this section are simply examples â€“ your own implementation may differ depending on the structure of your app). Midtrans Checkout has 3 required parameters:

 **Order ID**
 
 This value must be unique, you can use it once
 
  `NSString *orderID = @"some order id";`
 
**Transaction Detail**

This method is called, as you might expect, when the payment context's eg Order id, and gross amount of transaction

```
MIDCheckoutTransaction *trx = [[MIDCheckoutTransaction alloc] initWithOrderID:orderID grossAmount:@1000];
``` 



Then you can put it all together to generate the checkout token with this simple method
	
```
- (void) checkout {
  NSDate *date = [NSDate new];
  NSString *orderID = @"Some unique order id"
  MIDCheckoutTransaction *trx = [[MIDCheckoutTransaction alloc] initWithOrderID:orderID grossAmount:@1000];
    
  [[MIDClient shared] checkoutWith:trx options:@[gopay] completion:^(MIDToken * _Nullable token, NSError * _Nullable error) {
        NSLog(@"Token: %@", token.dictionaryValue);
        [self fetchPaymentInfo:token.token];
    }];
 }
```

### Custom with Options
This guide covers how to use the individual components of our SDK.

> **This guide assumes you've already followed the Getting Started section of our main tutorial to install and configure our SDK.**

**Customer info**

The `MIDCheckoutCustomer` class makes it easy to let your apps manage their customer information that will be attached on checkout process.

```
 MIDCheckoutCustomer *customer = [[MIDCheckoutCustomer alloc] initWithFirstName:@"Customer Firstname"
                                                                         lastName:@"Customer Last Name"
                                                                            email:@"customer@somemail.com"
                                                                            phone:@"00000000"
                                                                   billingAddress:nil
                                                                  shippingAddress:nil];
```
**Items info**

The `MIDItem ` class makes it easy to let your apps manage the item information that will be attached on checkout process.

```
   MIDItem *items = [[MIDItem alloc] initWithID:@"items id"
                                           price:2000
                                        quantity:1
                                            name:@"Item Name"
                                           brand:@"Brand"
                                        category:@"Some Category"
                                    merchantName:@"Merchant Name"];
```
